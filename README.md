## A story about me
When I was younger, my mother used to make me plans for the holidays. She made sure that I enjoy every single moment and be productive at the same time, so Yes! simple DIY projects were the best to suggest. Every week I did a small project, and I loved making accessories with polymer clay the most, I made a lot of unique pieces and kept many of them. I adore making handcrafts and I found that it would be a great opportunity to share my passion with others through this project. It wasn't hard for me to plan and know what kind of website I want to make and how I was going to design it. So to everyone who love on-of-kind items I think this can be a place you would love to visit regularly!
